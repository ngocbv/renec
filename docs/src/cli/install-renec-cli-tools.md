## Download Prebuilt Binaries
### Linux

Download the binaries by navigating to
[https://github.com/remitano/renec/releases/latest](https://github.com/remitano/renec/releases/latest),
download **renec-release-x86_64-unknown-linux-msvc.tar.bz2**, then extract the
archive:

```bash
tar jxf renec-release-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.bz2
cd renec-release/
export PATH=$PWD/bin:$PATH
```

### MacOS

Download the binaries by navigating to
[https://github.com/remitano/renec/releases/latest](https://github.com/remitano/renec/releases/latest),
download **renec-release-x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.bz2**, then extract the
archive:

```bash
tar jxf renec-release-x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.bz2
cd renec-release/
export PATH=$PWD/bin:$PATH
```

## Build From Source

If you are unable to use the prebuilt binaries or prefer to build it yourself
from source, navigate to
[https://github.com/remitano/renec/releases/latest](https://github.com/remitano/renec/releases/latest),
and download the **Source Code** archive. Extract the code and build the
binaries with:

```bash
./scripts/cargo-install-all.sh .
export PATH=$PWD/bin:$PATH
```

You can then run the following command to obtain the same result as with
prebuilt binaries:

```bash
renec-install init
```
