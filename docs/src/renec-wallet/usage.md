After creating a Renec wallet in previous step, we can access Renec wallet dashboard. In here we can see list of RENEC and other
tokens on Remitano network.

### Sending a token

Choose a token you want to send and click on `Send` button.

All you need to do is inputing recipient address and amount you want to send. If this address doesn't have funds, you need to check on `I'm aware that this address has no funds or this might be an exchange wallet`,
then click on `Send`.

### Receiving a token

Choose a token you want to send and click on `Receive` button or just click on `Receive` button on top. In Remitano network all tokens use one address for depositing even RENEC.

You can copy that address or using QR code.
