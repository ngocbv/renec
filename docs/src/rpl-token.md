The Renec Program Library (RPL) is a collection of on-chain programs targeting
the Sealevel parallel runtime.
These programs are tested against Renec's implementation
of Sealevel, and deployed to its mainnet. As others implement
Sealevel, we will graciously accept patches to ensure the programs here are
portable across all implementations.
